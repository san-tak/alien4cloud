    Given I am authenticated with "ADMIN" role
    And I have uploaded the archive "tosca-normative-types-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
    And I upload a plugin
    And I successfully create an orchestrator named "Mount doom orchestrator" and plugin id "alien4cloud-mock-paas-provider" and bean name "mock-orchestrator-factory"
    And I successfully enable the orchestrator "Mount doom orchestrator"
    And I create a location named "Thark location" and infrastructure type "OpenStack" to the orchestrator "Mount doom orchestrator"

  Scenario: Get a location and check policies types parsing
    When I get the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"
    Then I should receive a RestResponse with no error
    And I register the rest response data as SPEL context of type "alien4cloud.rest.orchestrator.model.LocationDTO"
    Then The SPEL expression "resources.policyTypes.size()" should return 2

  @reset
  Scenario: Create a policy template
    When I create a policy resource of type "org.alien4cloud.mock.policies.AntiAffinity" named "AntiAffinity" related to the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"
    Then I should receive a RestResponse with no error
    When I get the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"
    Then I should receive a RestResponse with no error
    And The location should contains a policy resource with name "AntiAffinity" and type "org.alien4cloud.mock.policies.AntiAffinity"

  @reset
  Scenario: Delete a location policy template should succeed
    Given I create a policy resource of type "org.alien4cloud.mock.policies.AntiAffinity" named "AntiAffinity" related to the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"
    When I delete the policy resource named "AntiAffinity" related to the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"
    Then I should receive a RestResponse with no error
    When I get the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"
    Then The location should not contain a policy resource with name "AntiAffinity" and type "org.alien4cloud.mock.policies.AntiAffinity"

  @reset
  Scenario: Update a location policy resource property
    Given I create a policy resource of type "org.alien4cloud.policies.mock.SimpleConditionPolicyType" named "SimpleConditionPolicyType" related to the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"
    When I update the property "sample_property" to "test_update_property" for the policy resource named "SimpleConditionPolicyType" related to the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"
    Then I should receive a RestResponse with no error
    Given I get the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"
    When I register the rest response data as SPEL context of type "alien4cloud.rest.orchestrator.model.LocationDTO"
    Then The SPEL expression "resources.policyTemplates[0].template.properties['sample_property'].value" should return "test_update_property"

  @reset
  Scenario: Update a location policy resource non-existing property should fail
    Given I create a policy resource of type "org.alien4cloud.mock.policies.AntiAffinity" named "AntiAffinity" related to the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"

    Then I should receive a RestResponse with an error code 504

  @reset
  Scenario: Updating a policy template name
    Given I create a policy resource of type "org.alien4cloud.mock.policies.AntiAffinity" named "AntiAffinity" related to the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"
    When I update the policy resource name from "AntiAffinity" to "MinimalPolicyType_Renamed" related to the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"Thark location"
    Then I should receive a RestResponse with no error
