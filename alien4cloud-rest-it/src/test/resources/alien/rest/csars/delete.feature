  Background:
    Given I am authenticated with "ADMIN" role
    And there is a user "golum" with the "COMPONENTS_MANAGER" role
    And I add a role "APPLICATIONS_MANAGER" to user "golum"
    And I add a role "ARCHITECT" to user "golum"
    Given I am authenticated with user named "golum"
    And I upload the archive "tosca base types 1.0"
    And I should receive a RestResponse with no error
    Given I upload the archive "valid-csar-with-test"
    And I should receive a RestResponse with no error

  @reset
  Scenario: Try do delete a CSAR that is a target dependency
    When I delete a CSAR with id "tosca-base-types:1.0"
    Then I should receive a RestResponse with an error code 507
    And I should have a delete csar response with "1" related resources

  Scenario: Try do delete a CSAR that is used in a topology
    Given I create a new application with name "watchmiddleearth" and description "Use my great eye to find frodo and the ring." and node templates

    And I save the topology
    When I delete a CSAR with id "topology-test:2.0-SNAPSHOT"
    Then I should receive a RestResponse with an error code 507
    And I should have a delete csar response with "3" related resources
    And The delete csar response should contains the following related resources
      | watchmiddleearth | Topology editor |
      | watchmiddleearth | csar            |
      | watchmiddleearth | APPLICATION     |
    When I delete a CSAR with id "tosca-base-types:1.0"
    Then I should receive a RestResponse with an error code 507
    And I should have a delete csar response with "4" related resources
    And The delete csar response should contains the following related resources
      | watchmiddleearth | Topology editor |
      | topology-test    | csar            |
