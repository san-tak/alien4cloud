Feature: Manage location policies resources authorizations in batch mode

  Background:
    Given I am authenticated with "ADMIN" role
    And There are these users in the system
      | frodon  |
      | sam     |
      | gandalf |
    And There are groups in the system
      | lordOfRing |
      | hobbits    |
      | elves      |
    And I add the user "frodon" to the group "lordOfRing"
    And I add the user "sam" to the group "hobbits"
    And I upload the archive "tosca-normative-types-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
    And I upload a plugin
    And I create an orchestrator named "Mount doom orchestrator" and plugin id "alien4cloud-mock-paas-provider" and bean name "mock-orchestrator-factory"
    And I enable the orchestrator "Mount doom orchestrator"
    And I create a location named "middle_earth" and infrastructure type "OpenStack" to the orchestrator "Mount doom orchestrator"
    Given I grant access to the resource type "LOCATION" named "middle_earth" to the user "frodon"
    Given I grant access to the resource type "LOCATION" named "middle_earth" to the group "lordOfRing"

    When I create a policy resource of type "org.alien4cloud.mock.policies.AntiAffinity" named "MinimalPolicyType2" related to the location "Mount doom orchestrator"/"middle_earth"
    Then I should receive a RestResponse with no error
